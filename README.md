# Breakout2024

The game I decided to do was Breakout which is a classic arcade game.
To play, control the paddle with the left and right arrow keys this will launch the ball, aiming to break all the bricks by deflecting the ball with the paddle.
Prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen so that you dont lose. The game is won by clearing all the bricks,with scores increasing for each brick broken.
